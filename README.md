Project Scenario

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 
To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, 
while still maintaining timely service to their customers.

Solution

Reorganizing Inventory:
Table 1 shows warehouse capacity. The South warehouse could be absorbed into the East or West warehouse. Table 2 lists warehouse product lines 
giving the option of redistributing the South product lines among remaining warehouses.

Reducing Inventory:
Table 3 lists products and orders and predicts how long inventory will last. Table 4 lists these inventory predictions by product line.
Table 5 shows orders and inventory predictions by warehouse. Based on these predictions if current inventory were reduced to the ten 
year order prediction the North as well as the South warehouse could be eliminated. If current inventory were reduced to the 
five year order prediction only one warehouse would be needed.
